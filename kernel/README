It is divided into subdirectories that are sorted out logically:

  acpi/       Contains an ACPI implementation.
  boot/       Contains the kernel loader.
  blkdev/     "BLocK DEVices", contains device drivers for storage devices, including ATA and AHCI.
  firmware/   Contains firmware drivers, such as PCI and (someday) HPET.
  fonts/      Contains bitmap fonts for use by the kernel.
  fs/         Contains low-level filesystem drivers.
  gui/        Contains a minimal graphics library and event-driven windowing system.
  iodev/      Contains device drivers for I/O devices, like the mouse and keyboard.
  keymaps/    Contains scancode and ASCII character mapping tables.
  mm/         Contains the low-level memory manager.
  tasking/    Contains the scheduler, system calls and other multitasking things.
  x86/        Contains things specific to x86, such as PIC, APIC, CPU modes, etc...
  misc/       Contains things that don't fit into any category from the above.
